    """Real-time web search via DeepSeek — your primary research tool.

    Searches are performed server-side by DeepSeek and return the pages that were
    actually retrieved (URL, title, and sometimes an excerpt), plus a summary
    synthesized from them.

    Use it liberally for anything that's not in your training data:

    - Current CVEs, advisories, and 0-days for a specific
      service/version (``OpenSSH 9.6 RCE``, ``Jenkins 2.401.3 auth
      bypass``).
    - Latest WAF / EDR bypass techniques (``Cloudflare WAF SQLi
      bypass 2025``, ``CrowdStrike Falcon evasion``).
    - Tool documentation, flag references, payload galleries.
    - Target reconnaissance / OSINT (company tech stack, leaked
      credentials, exposed assets).
    - Cloud-provider misconfiguration patterns
      (Azure/AWS/GCP-specific attack paths).
    - Bug-bounty writeups and security research papers.
    - Compliance frameworks and CWE/CVSS guidance.
    - Picking the right Python lib / Kali tool for a job (``best 2025
      lib for JWT alg-confusion``).
    - When stuck — looking up the exact error message, ``Access
      denied`` quirks, kernel-specific local-privesc exploits.

    Be specific: include version numbers, error messages, target
    technology, and the exact problem you're stuck on. The more context
    in the query, the more actionable the answer. Vague queries get
    generic answers.

    Each call returns ``sources`` (the pages actually retrieved, with
    ``url``/``title``) plus a ``content`` summary. Cite ``sources`` — not
    the summary — when a URL matters. If it reports ``success: false``,
    the search did not run: never present remembered information as
    retrieved.

    **Good example queries** (each is a full sentence, names a
    version/product, and asks one concrete thing):

    - ``"Found OpenSSH 7.4 on port 22 — any known RCE or privesc for
      this exact version?"``
    - ``"Cloudflare WAF is blocking my sqlmap on a login form — what
      bypass techniques work in 2025?"``
    - ``"Target runs WordPress 5.8.3 + WooCommerce 6.1.1 — current
      RCE chains for this combo?"``
    - ``"Low-priv shell on Ubuntu 20.04 kernel 5.4.0-74-generic — what
      local privesc exploits hit this kernel?"``
    - ``"Compromised domain user on Windows Server 2019 AD — quietest
      paths to Domain Admin without tripping EDR?"``
    - ``"'Access denied' uploading a webshell to IIS 10.0 — alternate
      Windows IIS upload bypass techniques?"``
    - ``"Discovered Jenkins 2.401.3 on staging — current authn-bypass
      and RCE exploits for this version?"``
    - ``"Best 2025 Python lib for JWT algorithm-confusion + weak-secret
      cracking?"``

    Args:
        query: The search query — a full sentence with version numbers,
            target tech, and the specific question. Treat it like a
            ticket title for a senior security engineer.
